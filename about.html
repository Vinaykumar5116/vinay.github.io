            <p>Zomoto provides good tasty foods with all types of veg and non veg & Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[6][7][8]
                With the introduction of  domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food[9][22].
                
                In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[10] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[11] Qatar,[12] the United Kingdom,[13] the Philippines,[12] and South Africa.[14] In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand,[15] Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages.[16] In April 2014, it was launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.[17][18][19]
                
                In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.[20] This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.
                
                In an effort to expand its business beyond restaurant listing, Zomato started its food delivery service in India in 2015,[21] initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.
                
                In April 2015, Zomato acquired the American online table reservation platform.</p>
